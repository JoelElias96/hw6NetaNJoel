# Exercise 6 ‚Äì Interactive Basketball Shooting Game with Physics

**Authors:** Joel Elias & Neta Nakdimon  
**Course:** Computer Graphics - Spring Semester 2025

## Overview
This exercise extends HW05 basketball court infrastructure by implementing interactive controls, physics-based movement, realistic basketball shooting mechanics, rotation animations, and a comprehensive scoring system. This transforms the static 3D basketball court into a fully interactive shooting game.

## Implemented Features

### üèÄ **Physics-Based Basketball Movement**
- Realistic gravity simulation affecting basketball trajectory
- Proper parabolic arc physics for basketball shots  
- Ball bouncing mechanics with energy loss
- Ground collision detection and response
- Hoop/rim collision detection for successful shots

### üéÆ **Interactive Basketball Controls**
- **Arrow Keys**: Move basketball horizontally (left/right, forward/backward)
- **W/S Keys**: Adjust shot power (0-100% with visual feedback)
- **Spacebar**: Shoot basketball toward nearest hoop
- **R Key**: Reset basketball position to center court
- **O Key**: Toggle orbit camera controls (inherited from HW05)

### üéØ **Basketball Rotation Animations**
- Realistic ball rotation during movement and flight
- Rotation axis matches movement direction
- Rotation speed proportional to ball velocity
- Smooth rotation transitions with basketball spin effects

### üìä **Comprehensive Scoring System**
- Real-time score tracking and display (2 points per successful shot)
- Shot attempt counter
- Shot accuracy percentage calculation  
- Score display updated immediately upon successful shots
- Visual feedback for successful/missed shots ("SHOT MADE!" vs "MISSED SHOT")

### üñ•Ô∏è **Enhanced User Interface**
- Live display of current score
- Shot attempts and accuracy statistics
- Current shot power indicator
- Control instructions panel
- Game status messages (shot made/missed)
- Ball flight status indicator

## Technical Implementation

### Physics System
- **Gravity**: Constant downward acceleration (-0.8 scaled units)
- **Trajectory**: Parabolic path calculation based on shot angle and power
- **Collision Detection**: Ball-to-ground and ball-to-rim collision
- **Energy Loss**: Realistic bounce damping (0.6 coefficient of restitution)
- **Bounce Limiting**: Maximum 8 bounces to prevent infinite bouncing

### Shot Mechanics  
- Adjustable shot power affecting initial velocity
- Automatic targeting of nearest hoop
- Enhanced trajectory calculation ensuring ball can reach hoops
- Proper arc height requirement for successful shots
- Strict scoring detection (ball must pass through rim area while moving downward)

### Visual Features
- Stadium environment with bleachers
- 3D physical scoreboard
- Realistic basketball court with proper markings
- Court boundaries preventing ball from leaving play area
- Real-time UI updates with color-coded feedback

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open Browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Controls Reference

| Control | Function | Details |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Arrow Keys** | Move Basketball | Left/Right/Forward/Backward movement with boundary checking |
| **W/S Keys** | Adjust Shot Power | Increase/Decrease power (0-100%) with visual indicator |
| **Spacebar** | Shoot Basketball | Launch ball toward nearest hoop with physics trajectory |
| **R Key** | Reset Basketball | Return ball to center court, reset power to 50% |
| **O Key** | Toggle Camera | Enable/disable orbit camera controls |

## Scoring System

- **Points per Shot**: 2 points for successful shots
- **Shot Detection**: Ball must pass through hoop area while moving downward
- **Statistics Tracked**: 
  - Total Score
  - Shots Made / Shot Attempts  
  - Shooting Accuracy Percentage
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded messages for made/missed shots
